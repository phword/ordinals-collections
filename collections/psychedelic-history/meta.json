    "description": "Composed of 2 sub-collections; 10 Sub15k artifacts (origins) and 36 sub70k artifacts (warriors). A digital monument immortalized on the Bitcoin blockchain aims to capture a fragment of the essence of 20th and early 21st-century psychedelic culture. These digital artifacts are protected by the oldest and most secure blockchain technology, serving as a means to perpetually preserve a part of the memories from this beautiful chapter in human history, which involves researchers, doctors, chemists, pharmacologists, botanists, spiritual leaders, substances, and rebels. They approached the advocacy of drugs and psychedelic substances from various angles, often transcending legality, and made significant contributions to the culture of psychedelics, science and spirituality, paving the way for a future of chemical-human symbiosis.",
